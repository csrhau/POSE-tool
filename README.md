The user will then be prompted for the following parameters:
a) Metric, defaults to ED^2P
b) System Min Power - the Pmin value measured
b) System Max Power - the Pmax value measured
c) Code name - the name of the code being modelled. Used for display purposes.
d) Code energy (J) - The energy consumed in Joules when running the code
e) Code Time (S) - The duration of the run in seconds
f) Report Template: The erb template used to prepare the report. Defaults to a 
                    latex report template.
g) Output Filename: The path to output the report to. Defaults to {CodeName}.tex

This tool produces latex output by default. A further compilation stage will
typically be required to produce usable output. This will typically be:

pdflatex {CodeName}.tex

Other output formats can be generated by using different report templates.
